# LinuxUnixShellScripting-
Here I will put modified examples (or corrected examples!) from books that I study about Unix/Linux shell scripting
(mainly bash). Each book will have its own folder , and usually it will contain subfolders for chapters , 
or seperate files for chapters.
I will also note any errata that I notice.

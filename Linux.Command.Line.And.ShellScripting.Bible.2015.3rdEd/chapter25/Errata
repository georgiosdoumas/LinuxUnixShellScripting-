Page 687 Creating a user account
the command :
mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE ON test.* TO test IDENTIFIED by 'test';
should be 
mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE ON mytest.* TO test IDENTIFIED by 'test';
because the database name created in the previous page was "mytest".
For the rest of the command , the first test is for the username and the second 'test' is for the password of the username test.

This kind of things annoy me when I find them in books or guides , I would prefer something like : 
mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE ON dbtest.* TO usertest IDENTIFIED by 'usertestpasswd';

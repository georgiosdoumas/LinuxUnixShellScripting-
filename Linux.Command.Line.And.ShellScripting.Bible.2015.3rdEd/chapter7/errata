Creating new groups
The book gives 2 examples (after creating a group "shared" , that as a freshly created group has no members initially) 
# /usr/sbin/usermod -G shared rich
# /usr/sbin/usermod -G shared test
and with the above code , someone would manage to make user rich a member of the group shared and also user test a member
of the group shared. That is good as long as the user "rich" and "test" were initially members of no other group but only 
of the default group that has the same name as the user. 
But if for example user "rich" was all ready member of a group "testgroup" , and we wanted to make him also a member of group
shared , without removing him from group "testgroup" , then the above command would not work , because it would replace
group "testgroup" with "shared". The way to do it would be 
# /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G shared rich
It is unfortunate that the text of the book keeps things confused by saying (just before the NOTE on page 174): 
"The -G parameter in usermod appends the new group to the list of groups for the user account."
If a group is not mentioned in a comma seperated list of values after -G , it will be removed.
So either we have to 
# /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G shared rich
or 
# /usr/sbin/usermod  -G testgroup,shared rich
if we want to keep membership on existing testgroup for user "rich".

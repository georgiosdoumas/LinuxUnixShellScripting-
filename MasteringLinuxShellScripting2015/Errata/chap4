with 
   abbr <shortcut>  <string>

The following line has many problems: 
  abbr _if if [-z $1];then<CR>echo "> $0 <name><CR>exit 2<CR>fi
Correct is :
  abbr _if if [ -z $1 ];then<CR>echo "> $0 <name>"<CR>exit 2<CR>fi
(spaces between [ and -z are important , also the closing " for echo . In page 47 a similar multiline code-snippet appears correct)

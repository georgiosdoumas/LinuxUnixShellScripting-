page 126
In the middle of the page (before the 2nd screenshot) there is an extra " :
  $ awk 'BEGIN {FS=":" ; printf "%10s %4s %17s\n",""Name","UID","Shell"}
but in the screenshot it is displayed corectly as :
  $ awk 'BEGIN {FS=":" ; printf "%10s %4s %17s\n","Name","UID","Shell"}

page 126 
2nd line from bottom missing a )
     > BEGIN {FS=":" ; green("    Name:     UID:      Shell:"}
should be 
     > BEGIN {FS=":" ; green("    Name:     UID:      Shell:") }
Again this is correctly displayed in the screenshot of next page , so it is not important , readers will see it easily.

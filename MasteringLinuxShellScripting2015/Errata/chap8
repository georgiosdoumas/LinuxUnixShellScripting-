Change the text 
  In this case, grep is searching for a very simple regular expression, "RX packet". 
to the following (the only correction is on word packets)

A funny typo mistake in the screenshot:
The line after the if :
  echo "The user $REPLY exits"
should be :
  echo "The user $REPLY exists"
And of course the output then would be 
  The user pi exists

page 100 Working with alternate spellings
I suggest that the 2 examples are changed to : 
  $ echo -e "color\ncolour\ncolar" | grep color
and 
  $ echo -e "color\ncolour\ncolar" | grep -E 'colou?r'

page 104
The last line of code , in the screenshot , is not in agreement with what was stated just before:
   pi@pilabs~$ sed -i ' /^pi/ s@bash@sh@pg ' 
It should be 
   pi@pilabs~$ sed -i ' /^pi/ s@/bin/bash@/usr/bin/sh@ ' 
The most important mistake is not that the book text has simply bash instead of /bin/bash , but the unnecessary pg at the end.

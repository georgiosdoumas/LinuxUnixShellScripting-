page 111 ,just above the NOTE
Change text : 
   translates to lines that begin with #\/VirtualHost, with the escaped forward slash.
with : 
   translates to lines that begin with #</VirtualHost, with the escaped forward slash.

page 111 last line 
Change "...main page is extensive"  with "...man page is extensive."

page 112 
The block code 
/^#<VirtualHost/,/^#<\/VirtualHost/ {
s/^#//
wtemplate.txt
}
has a missing space between w and template.txt , but in the screenshot provided , it is shown correctly. 

page 115
At the top of the page the text mentions :
   "Alternatively, you may choose to make use of the sudo command within the script."
This is not a trivial change (due to the redirections), many users will have to struggle a lot to manage all the details.
It would be convenient to give the modified script and let the reader figure the details into man pages. 
So I suggest the final presentation to be like this : 
   in the following example. We will be running the script directly as the root user.
   # vhost.sh sales.example.com
   Alternatively, you may choose to make use of the sudo command within the script,
   modifing following lines:
   [ -d $CONFDIR ] || sudo mkdir -p $CONFDIR
   sudo bash -c "sed s/dummy-host.example.com/$1/ $TEMPLATE > $CONFDIR/$1.conf"
   sudo mkdir -p $WEBDIR/$1
   sudo bash -c ' echo "New site for $1" > $WEBDIR/$1/index.html '
Another fine detail is that nothing is mentioned about the selinux context of the directories
/www/docs
Do we suppose that the readers using centos/redhat distros will know that it should be httpd_sys_content_t ?
I think it would be good if there was a simple hint in the text , like :
	Of course,if your linux distro requires it,you should make changes to the selinux content of the dir 
	/www/docs , and make it similar to the /var/www directory. You can check it with 
	$ ls -lZ /var/www
	$ ls -lZd /www

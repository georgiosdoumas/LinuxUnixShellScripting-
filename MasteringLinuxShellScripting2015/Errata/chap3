Substitute 
  $ test -a echo
with 
  $ type -a echo

The text says :
  "The read prompt cannot evaluate commands within the message string, such as we
   used before."
I am not sure what the writer wants to say , but I suggest to substitute it with 
   The read prompt can also  evaluate commands within the message string, such as we
   used before with echo. For example use this line in the previews script and test it:
   read -p "Hello $USER , I am $(basename $0). May I ask your name: " name

The last line of the script has missing spaces :
  mysql -u $user_name -p$mysql_pwd$mysql_db -e"$mysql_cmd"
A space must follow the last character of password value (how else will we know that the value finished?) , but I am not
completely sure if another space is required after the -e. Maybe it is acceptable to open the " just after -e , with no space,
but I would prefer for safety to put a space (there is no example without space in the 
webpage http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/command-line-options.html ,and I did not install mysql to test it). So better use :
  mysql -u $user_name -p$mysql_pwd $mysql_db -e "$mysql_cmd"

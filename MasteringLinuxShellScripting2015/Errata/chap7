the screenshot at the bottom of the page could better be like 
pi@pilabs ~ $ quote $USER
'pi' pi@pilabs ~ $
but it is not important. Obvioulsy the author had issued the command quote $USER in the previous line that does not
show in the screenshot , and types it again a 2nd time. The readers will understand.

page 86 
The script is like this : 
  function to_lower ()
  {
	input="$1"
	output=$(tr [A-Z] [a-z] <<< "$input")
	return $output
  }
  while true
  do
	read -p "Enter c to continue or q to exit: "
	$REPLY=$(to_lower "$REPLY")
	if [ $REPLY = "q" ] ; then
	break
but bash complains for the return usage (that it should be a numeric). So it is better to have the script like this: 
  to_lower ()  ## no need to use the function keyword since we use the () , it is good for the reader to see it
  {
	input="$1"
	output=$(tr [A-Z] [a-z] <<< "$input")
	echo $output
  }
  while true
  do
	read -p "Enter c to continue or q to exit: "
	REPLY=$(to_lower "$REPLY")       ##  NOT $REPLY=$( ...) . In page 88 it is correctly stated as REPLY=$(
	if [ $REPLY = "q" ] ; then
	break

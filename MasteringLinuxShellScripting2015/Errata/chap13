page 155 Creating arrays
The last line of code has something to be avoided (propably just a miss-typing):
  print("$user[0] $user[1] is @user[2]\n");
Although it works as it is , if we have the warnings turned on with :
$ perl -w array.pl
we get suggestions to write the last element as $user[2] .
So better have it as :
  print("$user[0] $user[1] is $user[2]\n");


page 159 Creating the function
I tested the code with 
  use warnings;
and it complains about the fact that the function is called before it is defined.
So is it really a good advice to tell the user that he can define functions at the end of his program?

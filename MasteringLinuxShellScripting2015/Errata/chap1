What this book covers
Chapter2 "...asking for installation directories or server's tp connect to."
		 "...asking for installation directories or servers to connect to."

Chapter 1
page 2 :
The text of the book has no space before 'BASH_ , it is like this:
$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable''BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"
But the correct is to have a space (do not hesitate to put 2 spaces for clarity in the printed and pdf format, like I did here):
$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable'  'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"
With the space , the reader will get the output of warning and error for the functions definitions.

page 3 : 
It is always good to avoid the code breaking in more than 1 line. So the code that appears like this:
cd /tmp; rm -f /tmp/echo; env 'x=() { (a)=>\' bash -c "echo date"; cat /
tmp/echo
would be better presented like this (putting the prompt $ also is helpfull for the reader):
$ cd /tmp; 
$ rm -f /tmp/echo;env 'x=() { (a)=>\' bash -c "echo date";cat /tmp/echo

The text says : 
"If the output from either of these command lines is different, then your system ..."
We could enhance it by mentioning :
"If the output from either of these command lines is different,for example if in the last command you have the output of current date,
instead of the word : date ,or if in the previous command you see the word vulnerable along with some syntax errors,  then your system ..."

page 5, Command PATH
  The sentence 
"Linux will check for executables in the PATH environment only when the full or
relative path to the program is supplied" 
is ambigous , and because we want the reader to interpret it as :
"Linux will check for executables in the PATH environment only, when the full or
relative path to the program is supplied."
and not as the confusing :
"Linux will check for executables in the PATH environment, only when the full or
relative path to the program is supplied" 
it is better to put that comma after "only,".
  And the sentence :
"This appends the current directory to the value of the PATH variable each item the
PATH is separated using the colon.Now, your PATH is updated to include the current
working directory ..."
should be changed to 
"This appends the current directory to the value of the PATH variable, each item in the
PATH is separated using the colon.Now,and for your current login session only, your PATH is 
updated to include the current working directory ..."

page 6, Configuring vim
Spaces have been forgotten in the contents of .vimrc! Correct is : 
 When these options are set, the $HOME/.vimrc file should look similar to this:
 set showmode nohlsearch
 set autoindent tabstop=4
 set expandtab
 syntax on

page 6, Configuring nano 
Similarly the spaces have dissapeared! Correct is :
 set autoindent
 set tabsize 4
 include /usr/share/nano/sh.nanorc

For both the above cases , I have not checked the downloadable example code in the website.

page 8 , just after the picture  :
"For the rest of the book, we will be working on the command line in and in vim"
Correct is 
"For the rest of the book, we will be working on the command line in nano and in vim"

page 9, Hello World 
First bullet :
"The shebang instructs the system to the interpreter to execute the script."
Suggestion for improvement:
"The shebang instructs the system which interpreter to use while executing the script."


page 10 , Checking the exit status
A space is missing after $?
Current text:       "To read the exit code from our script explicitly,we can view the $?variable,as shown..."
Correct should be : "To read the exit code from our script explicitly,we can view the $? variable,as shown..."

page 11 , Ensuring a unique name
Substitute : "and building commands," on the 4th line , with "and builtin commands,"
Substitute : "where we do not file extensions," on the 7th line , with "where we do not use file extensions,"

page 12, Running the script with arguments
Substitute 
  $ hello1.shfred
with ( a space was lost!)
  $ hello1.sh fred

page 12, after the table
Suggestion for improvement 
The text says : "Let's first copy the script, add in the execute permissions,"
It would be a good idea to put a numbered footnote after the word permissions , with number [1] , 
and at the end of the page have the note saying:
[1] You can copy the file and preserve the executable ermissions with cp -p , check the man pages for cp for details. 

page 13 
Again missing spaces in the middle of the page
$ hello2.shfredwilma  betty barney
but now it is not important ,because everything is clear in the following screenshot:
$ hello2.sh fred wilma  betty barney
so even newbbies will have no frushtration.

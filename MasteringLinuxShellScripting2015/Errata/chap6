page 67 
The script at the bottom of page has a missing space in the delimiter 
  $ for user in $(who | cut -f1 -d"") ; do
but that is not so important because in the screenshot of page 68 the correct form is shown. 
What is more important is that if we execute that script as a simple user , and there are other users also 
logged in , we will not have access to their current working directories.
So either the line should be like 
  # for user in $(who | cut -f1 -d" ") ; do
to imply that we have changed to root user , or again it is a nice opportunity to teach something to the reader
and have the line as 
  $ su -c ' for user in $(who | cut -f1 -d" ") ; do \
  lsof -u $user -a -c bash | grep cwd \
  done '
This way the reader will have the chance to become familiar with the 
su -c "command1; command2" 
or alternatively 
su -c 'command1; command2' 
if somewhere inside the command1 / command2 there are double quotes " used. 

page 72 
There is a typo mistake in the screenshot (how can that have happened?!)
The line 
  > ping -c1 "$server" && servers_up="servers_up $servers"
should be 
  > ping -c1 "$server" && servers_up="servers_up $server"


page 73 
At the end of the script the imput file is missing , so :
  done
should be replaced with :
  done < $1

page 135 Displaying the highest ranking IP address
The final code has a variable , maxnumber, that is not used anywhere
 { ip[$1]++ }
 END {
   for (i in ip)
     if ( max < ip[i] ) {
       max = ip[i]
       maxnumber = i }
 print i, " has accessed ", ip[i], " times." }
It could be like this :
 { ip[$1]++ }
 END {
   for (i in ip)
     if ( max < ip[i] ) { max = ip[i] }
 print i, " has accessed ", ip[i], " times." }
I have test the above , and it works.
But actually I suggest a different use of variable names ,to make things more clear:
 { hits[$1]++ }
 END {
   for (ip in hits)
     if ( max < hits[ip] ) { max = hits[ip] }
 print ip, " has accessed the server ", hits[ip], " times." }
